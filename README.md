To install brew

open the terminal :--> run the following command 

/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" 

Once you have homebrew (and the Python installation of your choice) open up a terminal and run:

brew install portaudio 

This installs the requirement for the Speech Recognition library for Python. Afterwards, you can run: 

pip install pyaudio 

And finally: 

pip install SpeechRecognition 

And you have the requirements in place! 

# run the script by :

python SpeechRecognizer.py

Thank You
